This is the domain package. It's purpose is to have all the entity objects and logic. 
It corresponds to the principle behind DDD in order to keep the domain as a model of the business without an extra abstraction in between.

Think at least three times bevore introducing frameworks!

The domain should only depend on itself otherwise the architecture is destroeyed.
