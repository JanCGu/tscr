The service layer is the glue giving the service layer the instances of the
pluged in layers. 

Basicly all kinds of factories reside here and therefore allows dependency injection.
Spring in it's essance  is a framework for dependency incetion, but is not and
necessary and therefore its better to implement these feature through the use of
the factory patterns in combination with facade or singelton patterns.

In theory this package can be rewritten to do the binding for the plugin in runtime.
